\chapter{Findings and Conclusions}

\section{Growth and Change Environment}
\subsection{Planned Land Use Changes}
Characterization of destination regions—numbers, sizes, maps.

\subsection{Historical Patterns of Demand Change}
Discussion of MVA and citywide intrinsic growth model outputs.

\section{Workload / Demand Change Patterns}
\subsection{Geographic Demand Change Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantify magnitude, percentage, and variability of change.
    \item Tables and choropleth maps by station area, battalion, and city council ward.
    \item Citywide workload change heatmap.
    \item Emphasize metrics of uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\section{Predicted Impacts on Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trends by level 2 cause.
    \item Trends by severity level (0-6).
    \item Predicted UHU changes.
    \item Predicted change in 90th percentile IRT by station area.
    \item Predicted change in 90th percentile ERF for critical events by station area.
    \item Comparison of numbers of “missed calls” by station area or PZ.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
TBD.
